HOMEPAGE

In homepage, as pressing the card, card will turn around to show the translation. While pressing "Next" button, you will be able to go to next word or pressing "Previous" button, you will be able to go to back in words.

While pressing Speaker button, the audio files that I have downloaded from Google Translate, will be playe for each word.

In profile, I showed name and image data that I collected from user with asyncstorage in INFORMATION. Under these, I showed daily words that user can turn a card. For total numbers of words from words.json, i only showed total numbers.
